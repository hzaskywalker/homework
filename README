my homework

the core code are:

misc/cache/*
misc/isa.c
pipe/pipe-full.hcl
pipe/psim.c

before running, please:

make
cd misc/cache/
make
(Notice I omit gui and tk, and there is no -lfl on mac)
and revise the path '/Users/hza/blabla' in shareinfo to any path exists on your computer.

To know the usage of cache and test it, please see
misc/cache/test_one_cache.py
and
misc/cache/test_two_cache.py
sim_two_cache.py would check the output of cache if you add DEBUG into misc/cache/Makefile

I add an instruction 'test' into y86.
test would test whether the memory is 0, copy the value on memory into a registrator, and let the value memory increase 1.
To run the y86 code, just:

cd pipe
python run_two_sim.py
Then there would be two cpu and communicate with each other.

The y86 codde is pipe/ans.ys
